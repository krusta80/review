Some notes for the Angular assessment (NOT APPROVED TO BE USED DURING THE ASSESSMENT!!!)
<br><br>
These study materials are strictly to be used to help review and study.  They are likely considered code and therefore unacceptable as references during the assessment.
<br><br>
Also, this document was created in sublime and meant for sublime (or similar modern editor).  The file extension is .js to leverage Sublime's slick syntax highlighting only...it does NOT run on its own and is meant simply as a study guide.
<br><br>
If you prefer not to go through the trouble of throwing it in Sublime, there are three image/snapshots of the code in all of its highlighted glory.
